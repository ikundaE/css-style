    you’ve probably heard of Lorem Ipsum before – it’s the most-used dummy text excerpt out there. People use it because
    it has a fairly normal distribution of letters and words (making it look like normal English), but it’s also Latin,
    which means your average reader won’t get distracted by trying to read it. It’s perfect for showcasing design work
    as it should look when fleshed out with text, because it allows viewers to focus on the design work itself, instead
    of the text. It’s also a great way to showcase the functionality of programs like word processors, font types, and
    more.

    We’ve taken Lorem Ipsum to the next level with our HTML-Ipsum tool. As you can see, this Lorem Ipsum is tailor-made
    for websites and other online projects that are based in HTML. Most web design projects use Lorem Ipsum excerpts to
    begin with, but you always have to spend an annoying extra minute or two formatting it properly for the web.
